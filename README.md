# Homework4

This webpage is a multiple choice quiz for the WSU football team.  The page is made up of HTML, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and jQuery elements.   At the top of the webpage is a header bar that displays the current score and a timer.  This element was used from a bootstrap navbar component.  Both the score and timer are changed dynamically through JavaScript.  Below the navbar is a header and paragraph containing info regarding the quiz.

The main components of the webpage are the buttons ( Begin, and answers) along with the questions.  These are all contained within specific elements with classes and IDs.  Upon clicking begin, the timer starts and the quiz beings.  The timer will run until it reaches zero seconds and at that time the timer stops at zero, indicating the quiz is over.  Upon clicking the answers the user will either be awarded 5 points if the answer is correct or zero if the answers is incorrect.  The score is updated dynamically based on the answer.  Additionally, once an answer has been clicked, the next questions with answers is presented.

For additional styling, I updated the colors of the page to match those of WSU.  I have also included an image of WSU that is centered with rounded corners from Bootstrap styling.
